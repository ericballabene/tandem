Hi. We are involved in a project, me and my tandem collegue Massimiliano, about supersimmetry and supersimmetry particles. Our goal is to perform a data analysis which benefits the signal with respect to the background as well as the sensitivity, defined as the Signal divided for signal plus background events. Our signal is the production of two supersimmetry particles, a chargino and a neutralino, from the hard scattering collision of two protons, in association with a Higgs boson and missing transverse momentum at the centre of mass energy of 13 Teraelectronvolt, recorded with the ATLAS detector. In the SUSY scenarios the lightest of the neutralinos which, together with the charginos (χ ̃±), represent the mass eigenstates formed from the mixture of the γ, W, Z and Higgs bosons’ gauge eigenstate superpartners. The way of decay of the the W and H boson determines the so called hadronic and leptonic channel. We can distinguish between four independent and mutually exclusive analysis channels based on the visible final state: hadronic decays of both the W and h (which is called 0 leptons bb ̄ ):  

The fully hadronic analysis channel exploits the large branching ratios for both W → qq ̄ and h → bb ̄. Particular event selections based on the masses of both the W and Higgs boson candidates, the presence of exactly two b-jets, and the kinematic relationships of the final state jets and Emiss, are required in order to reduce the significant backgrounds from tt ̄, Z + jets, and single-top Wt production.  
Hadronic h decays with leptonic W decays (1 lepton bb ̄) The events considered in the one lepton and two b-jets channel are also recorded with the Emiss trigger. Events with exactly one electron or muon are selected  if they also contain two or three jets with pT > 25 GeV, two of which must be b-tagged.  
Diphoton h decays with leptonic W decays (1lepton γγ and two photons); Events used in the single lepton plus diphoton (1lγγ) channel were recorded with a diphoton trigger using   a trigger-level requirement of ET > 35 GeV and ET > 25 GeV for the leading and sub-leading photons, respectively. For these events, the event selection requires exactly one lepton (e or μ) with pT > 25 GeV and exactly two photons  
Finally, Multilepton h decays via W, Z, τ and leptonic W decays. Here there are events in the 3l signal regions are categorized according to flavor and charge-sign combinations of  the leptons in the event. Appropriate selection criteria to each region are applied in order to reject lepton-rich background processes while at the same time maximizing signal significance.  

 Our analysis is performed through a software tool called HistFitter. Hist
Fitter is based on ROOT and Roofit libraries and has been used extensively by
the ATLAS Collaboration to analyze big datasets originating from proton-proton
collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Since 2012 HistFitter has
been the standard statistical tool in searches for supersymmetric particles
performed by ATLAS.
