Hi. We are involved in a project, me and my tandem collegue Massimiliano,
about supersimmetry and supersimmetry particles. Our goal is to perform a
data analysis which benefits the signal with respect to the background as 
well as the sensitivity, defined as the Signal divided for signal plus
background events. Our signal is the production of two supersimmetry particles,
a chargino and a neutralino, from the hard scattering collision of two protons, 
in association with a Higgs boson and missing transverse momentum at the centre 
of mass energy of 13 Teraelectronvolt, recorded with the ATLAS detector. In the 
SUSY scenario, the lightest of the neutralinos together with the charginos, represent the mass eigenstates formed from the mixture of the electroweak and Higgs bosons’ gauge eigenstate superpartners. The way of decay of the the W and H 
boson determines the so called hadronic and leptonic channel. We can distinguish 
between four independent and mutually exclusive analysis channels based on the 
visible final state. 

-The first one is called 0 leptons a bottom quark-antiquark, characterized by the presence of the hadronic decays of both the W and H.  
It is the fully hadronic analysis channel and exploits the large branching ratios 
for both the W and H bosons. Particular event selections based on the masses of 
both the W and Higgs boson candidates, the presence of exactly two b-jets, and the kinematic requests are required in order to reduce the
significant backgrounds processes.  
-The second channel is called 1 lepton bottom quark-antiquark and it is characterized by the hadronic decay of the Higgs boson and the leptonic decay of the W boson. The events 
considered in the one lepton and two b-jets channel are also recorded with a 
missing energy trigger. Events with exactly one electron or muon are selected  if they
also contain two or three jets with pT > 25 GeV, two of which must be b-tagged.  
-Another channel is the 1lepton diphoton channel with the leptonic decay of the W and the Higgs boson decay into two photons;
Events are selected using a diphoton trigger and missing transverse energy requested to be > 35 GeV and ET > 25 GeV for the leading and sub-leading photons, respectively. For these events, the event selection requires exactly one lepton (e or μ) with pT > 25 GeV.
 -Finally, there is the multilepton channel via W, Z, τ and leptonic W decays.
Here there are events in the 3l signal regions are categorized
according to flavor and charge-sign combinations of the leptons 
in the event. Appropriate selection criteria to each region are applied
in order to reject lepton-rich background processes while at the same
time maximizing signal significance.  

 Our analysis is performed through a software tool called HistFitter. Hist
Fitter is based on ROOT and Roofit libraries and has been used extensively by
the ATLAS Collaboration to analyze big datasets originating from proton-proton
collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Since 2012 HistFitter has
been the standard statistical tool in searches for supersymmetric particles
performed by ATLAS.




How HistFitter works:
HistFitter is a tool which allows to perform complete analysis by using a
simple configuration file written in Python.
The key idea in how it works is the definition of three regions obtained by
applying selections to a set of kinematic observables:
- signal region: region where a particular model that we want to study (SUSY
  in our case) predicts a significant excess of events over the predicted
background level;
- control region: specifically designed to be basically free of signal
  contamination, these region is used to control the dominant background by
comparing it to data samples;
- validation region: placed in between the other two regions, it is used to
  validate the model used to predict the number of bkg events in the SR.

The process is shown schematically in Fig. (?)

After the introduction of these regions, we can summarize the analysis
strategy flow in this way: by fitting the model to the data, the observed
event counts in CR are used to normalize background estimates in all regions;
the result goes under the name of "normalized background predictions". These
are then used for extrapolation into the VRs and SRs.

questa parte non saprei se metterla
We point out that the key ingredients of the fitting procedure are the so
called transfer factors, which basically allow the observations in the CR to
be converted into background estimates in the SRs.



To begin with the project, we executed a tutorial in HistFitter on real data containing
events about the production of supersimmetry particles along with a lepton (inclusive lepton). 
Before the fit, the plot gives an idea of the signal and background yields (here the signal 
is red and background is green), along with the data (black mark). 
After the fit is performed, you can see that those yields are forced as to
be equal to the data yield. The fit change the contribution of signal and 
background in order to be representative of the data. Finally, this is the 
correlation matrix. Here you can see that whereas the luminosity and other
systematic uncertainties are not correlated each other, the signal strength
mu_sig is correlated with those other quantities. All these parameters have
been evaluated by the histfitter tool.
